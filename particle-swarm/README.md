# Particle Swarm Optimization

## What Are They?

The PSO solves the problem by creating a population of candidate solutions, also known as particles, and moving these particles around the search space according to simple mathematical formulas about the particle's position and velocity. The movement of each particle is influenced by its best-known position and the best-known position of its neighborhood.

## Implemented Modules

For this algorithm, different modules were not implemented due to its simplicity, with the biggest variation being the way a particle perceives its neighborhood. In this implementation, we consider that each particle has access to all the others.


## Examples

- **Function Optimization Problem:** Finding the minimum or maximum of a function by moving the particles through the search space with a position representation of particles.

## Usage

First, install the requirements:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

In the test folder, there are usage examples for each implemented module.
